/**
 * BATCHES TABLE
 * 
 * Represents a single cycle
 * Each batch is a production cycle that processes multiple strains simultaneously.
 * 
 * Business Rules:
 * - New batch created for each cycle
 * - Batch number is sequential within each location (Location A: 1,2,3... Location B: 1,2,3...)
 * - Multiple batches can run simultaneously at same location due to cycle overlaps
 * - Typical overlap: 1 day or less when previous batch extends beyond its target day
 * - endDate remains null until batch completion (actual vs planned duration)
 * - Status changes from 'in_progress' â†’ 'published' when ALL strains completed
 * 
 * 
 * Relationships:
 * - One batch can contain multiple strains (via batchStrains)
 * - One batch has multiple work days (vary between 4-7 depending on location, amount of workers, etc)
